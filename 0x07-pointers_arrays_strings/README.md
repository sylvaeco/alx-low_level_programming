# Today is 28/Aug/2023, Welcome to the new week... Today's module/task is named `0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings`.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

# NB
The tasks covered are relatively advance in comparison to last week's.
Multi-dimension arrays (matrices in reality) were introduced. The use of pointers of
pointer was also taught.
I am starting to get more familiar with C progrmming syntax but i still get dazed sometimes :smiley:
